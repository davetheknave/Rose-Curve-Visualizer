## Summary
This is an online art project created to display the beauty hidden in the world of mathematics. It's intended to be accessible to all, including those who don't think of themselves as being good at math. Its controls encourage exploration; even subtle adjustments can create big changes.
## Instructions
At the top of the screen, one or more circular shapes will be visible. This shape is the curve produced by the polar function $r = -\sin(k\theta)$. Adjusting the controls will allow you to change this shape. The different controls all affect one another. It's recommended to experiment on your own, but here is a summary of each control just in case:
- The _numerator_ and _denominator_ of the fraction can each be a whole number between 1 and 25. Larger numbers in either or both produce more complex results.
- The _style_ toggle will switch between a polygon shape and a dashed curve shape. Both of them are based on the same shape created by the formula. Either style is strongly affected by the _quality_ slider.
- The _quality_ slider will break down the shape when lowered. How it does this is dependent on the _style_ toggle. In polygon mode, this means it will reduce the number of sides. In dashed mode, this will increase the space between dashes.
- The _speed_ slider will simply increase the speed of the motion of the shape. It has no effect when quality is at its highest.
- There is a _color_ picker that does what you'd expect.
